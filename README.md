## Description

​Hey hey people. New challenge here.

This was a big learning project! Lots of great new CSS selection tools.

The biggest learning curve here was figuring out precisely how to use the psuedoclass selectors.

The biggest learning curve was figuring out how to adjust the sizing of containers to suit our content, figuring out how to center things and why things would not center was a big pain.

Creating links that are also images, creating on hover effects, learning how to use linear gradient.

Semantically, I think the site could use improvements, I'm not 100% clear on how or where to put articles and sections.

All in all, it's an okay site. We built this site because building a portfolio website is an important task for any kind of web developer.

In the future, it would be nice to have some kind of overlay on each image with a label to show what they are.
